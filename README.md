Hello there 🤝🫶👋

Hey! I’m Danish, a 19-year-old B.Tech CSE student at ITM Skills University (2025–2029) from Mumbai, currently building a strong foundation in mathematics, machine learning, and deep learning.
My long-term curiosity points toward robotics, astrophysics, and space technology — especially the possibility of using intelligent systems to make industrializing space realistic, scalable, and economically feasible. I haven’t stepped into those fields yet, but they’re part of the bigger journey I’m preparing for.
For now, I’m fully focused on mastering the fundamentals that will make that future possible.

🎯 What I’m Focused On Right Now

I'm intentionally strengthening the core skills that matter most for anyone serious about ML engineering and future robotics/space applications:
Mathematics — linear algebra, calculus, probability, optimization
Machine Learning — from intuition to implementation
Deep Learning — architectures, training dynamics, practical applications
AI Engineering — understanding how real ML systems are built and deployed
This phase of my learning is all about depth: building the kind of foundation that supports ambitious work later on.

🌱 Where My Interests Are Heading

While I’m not working in robotics or space tech yet, these areas guide my long-term direction:
Intelligent systems for automation and autonomy
ML-driven robotics
Large-scale engineering problems in space
Future industrial infrastructure beyond Earth
Think of me as someone building the base tools now for the problems I want to solve later.

📚 Currently Learning

Right now, I’m diving deeply into:
Deep Learning theory and hands-on training
AI engineering workflows and tools
Improving mathematical intuition for ML

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python • PyTorch • NumPy • Matplotlib • Pandas
Jupyter Notebook • Git/GitHub • VSCode
Experiment tracking, debugging, and ML workflow basics

🚀 Long-Term Vision

To eventually work at the intersection of ML, robotics, and space technology — contributing to the systems that make space more accessible and industrially viable.
I’m not there yet, but every day I’m building the skills needed to reach that point.
